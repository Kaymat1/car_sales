As part of the Zero to Pandas course, I undertook a project involving the analysis of a dataset comprising information on over 3700 cars and their prices in Naira. The dataset was obtained through web scraping from Cars45, Nigeria's largest car sales website. It includes various features such as car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, price, and more.
