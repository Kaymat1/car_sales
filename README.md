# car_sales
This is my project at zero to pandas course where i analysed a dataset which contains 3700+ cars information and their prices in Naira. 
The data was web scraped from cars45, Nigeria's largest car sales website. The data contains features such as car make, model, year of manufacture, mileage, price, etc.
